Project Directory Structure:
`    <Project>
       | data/: Contains .txt files that define the graphs and problems used for testing and execution.
       | data_structures/: Holds custom data structures for each search algorithm.
       |-->     graph_classes/: Contains the adjacency_list.py and other files for the graph representation.
       |-->     queues/: Includes custom implementations for the fifo_queue.py, priority_queue.py, and stack_queue.py
       | search_algorithms/: Contains the implementation for each search algorithm.
       | testing/: Contains all unit and integration tests.
       |-->     unit_testing_data/: Stores the data files and corresponding .png visualizations for all unit tests.
       | text_file_handling/: Contains the text_file_data_extractor.py for parsing the problem text files.
       | textbook_abstractions/: Contains node.py and problem.py which are the abstractions used in the textbook.
       | old_files/: Contains the old files that were used for testing purposes and are not currently implemented in the 
         final solution, they may be disregarded or used as evidence of development.`


How to Run Unit Tests:
Please open the source code using your editor of choice, 
then you can either run each unit test individually or run all of them at once for a selected algorithm.
1. Open the project in your editor.
2. Select a unit test algorithm file from the unit testing folder.
3. Run the file using your editor's built-in unit testing framework.
4. The unit test will run and display the results.


How to Run the Program:
Please use the command line interface using Search.py. 
1. cd to the path that contains /Intro-to-AI-Assignment-2A
2. run python search.py data/PathFinder-test.txt bfs - returns the Breadth First Search
3. run python search.py data/PathFinder-test.txt dfs - returns the Depth First Search
4. run python search.py data/PathFinder-test.txt astar - returns the A* Search
5. run python search.py data/PathFinder-test.txt gbfs - returns the Greedy Best First Search
6. run python search.py data/PathFinder-test.txt dijkstra - returns the Dijkstra Search
Example: python search.py data/PathFinder-test.txt bfs
